# Algorithms & Problem Solving Level 1 - Professional C++ Solutions

## Course Overview
This course represents a fundamental shift in my programming mindset. Moving beyond simply "making code work," I revisited the 50 core algorithmic problems to implement them using **Clean Code** principles and the **Divide and Conquer** strategy. The focus was on architectural quality, maintainability, and code readability.

## Technical Skills & Concepts Applied
- **Modular Programming:** Transitioned from long, monolithic functions to small, atomic, and reusable functions.
- **Divide and Conquer:** Mastering the art of breaking down a single complex problem into smaller, manageable sub-problems.
- **Clean Code Practices:** Prioritizing meaningful naming conventions, reducing redundancy, and ensuring the code is self-explanatory.
- **Code Reusability:** Designing logic blocks (Functions) that can be reused across different parts of the application or in future projects.
- **Software Complexity Control:** Learning how to manage and scale code without losing control as the logic grows more intricate.

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Re-implemented **50 algorithms** with a focus on professional structure rather than just raw output.
- Developed a "Software Engineer" mindset: thinking about how code will be maintained, updated, and debugged in real-world scenarios.
- Established a solid foundation for building large-scale systems by mastering function-based building blocks.
