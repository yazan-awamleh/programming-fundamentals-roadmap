# OOP as it Should Be – Professional Applications

## Course Overview

This course represents the practical pinnacle of my Object-Oriented Programming journey. Moving beyond syntax and isolated concepts, I focused on building complete, professional-grade software systems. The core objective was to apply OOP design principles to control complexity, ensure system security, and develop scalable architectures through real-world projects.

## Technical Skills & System Engineering Mastered

### Professional Library Development

- Utility Library: Built a robust, reusable library containing essential tools for everyday programming tasks, emphasizing the "Write Once, Use Everywhere" principle.  
- Input & Validation Library: Designed a comprehensive system for handling user inputs, ensuring data integrity and professional error handling before processing.

### Advanced Bank System (The Core Project)

Designed and implemented a full-scale Banking System with multiple layers of complexity:

- Client & User Management: Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for clients and system users.  
- Transaction Engine: Handling deposits, withdrawals, and transfers with real-time balance updates.  
- Security & Permissions: Implementing a granular permissions system, secure login/logout flows, and password encryption within data files.  
- System Auditing: Building login registers and transfer logs to track every critical action within the system for auditing purposes.  
- System Resilience: Implementing security features like locking the system after multiple failed login attempts.

### Currency Exchange System

- Developed a specialized system for managing currency rates and performing complex conversions using a modular, object-oriented approach.

### Advanced C++ Programming

- Template Functions & Classes: Mastering generic programming to write highly flexible and type-independent code.  
- Abstract Classes & Interfaces: Applying pure virtual functions in real-world scenarios to define strict system blueprints.  
- File-Based Persistence: Managing data storage and retrieval through complex file operations with security layers.

## Engineering Mindset

- Scalability: Learning how to extend existing systems (Bank Extensions) without breaking or rewriting core logic.  
- Responsibility-Driven Design: Assigning clear responsibilities to each class to ensure a clean separation of concerns.  
- Professional Standards: Adhering to clean code practices, meaningful naming conventions, and organized project structures.
