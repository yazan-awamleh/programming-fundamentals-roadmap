# Programming Foundations - Level 1

## Course Overview
This course focuses on building the essential mental model required before engaging with any programming language syntax. It covers the fundamental principles of how computers process data and the underlying logic of software execution.

## Technical Skills 
- **Data Representation:** Understanding the transition from raw data to information and knowledge.
- **Computer Architecture:** Analyzing internal components, hardware functions, and memory terminology (Bits, Bytes, Nibbles).
- **Numeral Systems:** Proficiency in Binary, Hexadecimal, and Octal systems, including manual and technical conversion methods.
- **Execution Environment:** Understanding the roles of Compilers, Interpreters, Assemblers, and Linkers in the software development lifecycle.
- **Computational Logic:** Grasping variables, constants, operations, and calculation priorities independent of specific language syntax.

## Learning Objectives
- Developing a "Computer-Centric" thinking process.
- Understanding memory management and data storage at a low level.
- Establishing a solid foundation for learning high-level languages like C++, C#, and Python.
- Analyzing computer performance units and hardware-software interaction.
