# Introduction to Programming Using C++ – Level 2

This repository documents the completion of **Introduction to Programming Using C++ – Level 2**, a course focused on moving from writing functional C++ code to fully understanding how C++ programs execute internally.

The course emphasizes control, predictability, and deep technical understanding, shifting the approach from guessing why code works to knowing exactly how and why it works at runtime.

## Course Overview

This stage represents a transition from surface-level coding to engineering-level understanding. The focus was on mastering program execution flow, memory behavior, and professional debugging techniques, enabling precise control over C++ applications.

## Technical Skills and Mastery

- Professional debugging using breakpoints, watches, and step execution to inspect memory and control flow  
- Deep understanding of pointers and references, including stack vs heap memory and dynamic allocation  
- Safe and controlled use of dynamic memory management  
- Advanced function concepts including function overloading, default parameters, and recursion  
- Use of vectors and iterators for dynamic and efficient data handling  
- File system interaction through file input and output operations  
- Building custom C++ libraries to create reusable and maintainable code structures  

## Key Learning Outcomes

- Ability to debug and resolve complex logical and runtime errors with confidence  
- Strong understanding of variable lifetime, scope, and storage duration  
- Implementation of robust error handling using exception handling  
- Technical readiness to learn and adapt to other programming languages due to strong low-level foundations  

## Engineering Mindset Developed

- Transition from syntax-focused coding to control-focused engineering  
- Emphasis on predictability, visibility, and correctness in program behavior  
- Reduced reliance on trial-and-error through systematic debugging and analysis
