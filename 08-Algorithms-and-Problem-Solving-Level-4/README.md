# Algorithms & Problem Solving – Level 4

This repository documents the completion of **Algorithms & Problem Solving – Level 4**, the final and most advanced stage of the algorithmic problem-solving series.

This level focuses on advanced practice at scale, consistency under pressure, and real-world software readiness, representing the transition from advanced problem solving to system-level engineering.

## Course Overview

After completing three previous levels, this stage was designed to push limits through volume, endurance, and complexity. The emphasis shifted from individual problem correctness to maintaining structure, quality, and efficiency across large codebases and long-term development cycles.

## Technical Skills and Expertise

- High-volume problem solving through completing 65 advanced challenges  
- Consistent application of structured logic and clean code across large-scale solutions  
- System-level thinking when designing and implementing solutions  
- Strong pattern recognition and analytical speed in complex problem sets  
- Application of advanced C++ knowledge for efficient and robust implementations  
- Sustained use of divide and conquer techniques under increasing complexity  

## Key Highlights and Projects

- Implementation of 65 high-difficulty algorithmic challenges grouped by type and complexity  
- Design and development of two large-scale system projects  
- Focus on software architecture, maintainability, and scalability  
- Continuous refinement through an attempt, analysis, and improvement cycle  
- Adoption of professional-level solution patterns and engineering standards  

## Engineering Mindset Developed

- Programming endurance through long-form problem solving and large projects  
- Understanding that programming maturity is achieved by maintaining quality at scale  
- Confidence in approaching real-world software engineering challenges and complex systems
