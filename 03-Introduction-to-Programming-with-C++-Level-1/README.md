# Introduction to Programming with C++ - Level 1

## Course Overview
This course serves as the practical implementation phase of the roadmap. After mastering the mental models and algorithmic thinking in the previous levels, I transitioned into **C++** to apply these concepts using a powerful, low-level language. The focus was on writing meaningful code and understanding how high-level logic interacts with system resources.

## Technical Skills Acquired
- **C++ Syntax & Fundamentals:** Mastering the core structure of C++ programs, including preprocessor directives and the compilation process.
- **Data Management:** Working with various data types, constants, and understanding how variables are stored and manipulated in memory.
- **Control Flow:** Implementing complex logic using conditional statements (If, Switch) and various looping mechanisms (For, While, Do-While).
- **Modular Programming:** Building reusable and organized code using **Functions**, understanding scope, and passing parameters.
- **Data Structures (Basics):** Handling collections of data using **Arrays**, **Structures (struct)**, and **Enums**.
- **User Interaction:** Managing standard Input/Output (I/O) operations and formatting data effectively.

## Engineering Mindset
- **Logic Implementation:** Translating flowcharts and pseudo-code into functional C++ applications.
- **Code Structure:** Writing clean, readable, and well-commented code following professional standards.
- **Problem Solving with Code:** Applying mathematical and logical operators to solve real-world computational problems.
