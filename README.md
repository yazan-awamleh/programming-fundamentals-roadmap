# Programming Fundamentals Roadmap

This repository documents my learning journey through the **Programming Advice Programming Fundamentals Roadmap**, a comprehensive program composed of 24 courses designed to build a strong foundation in software engineering.

The roadmap emphasizes clean code practices, intensive problem solving using C++, and hands-on project-based learning. It progressively covers core programming concepts and advances into modern software development topics.

## Roadmap Scope
The courses in this roadmap span a wide range of essential software engineering topics, including:
- Programming fundamentals and clean coding practices
- Problem solving through intensive practice
- C++ programming with multiple practical projects
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Data Structures and algorithms
- Databases and SQL
- C# and Windows Forms applications
- RESTful API development

## Repository Structure
Each course in the roadmap is organized in its own folder containing:
- The course completion certificate
- A dedicated markdown file describing the course content and learning outcomes

This structure allows the repository to serve as both a learning log and a centralized reference for completed and ongoing courses.

## Status
This roadmap is currently **in progress**, and the repository is continuously updated as new courses are completed.

---

*All courses and learning materials in this repository are based on the Programming Advice platform.*

## Program Instructor
All courses in this roadmap are designed and delivered by **Dr. Mohammad Abu-Hadhoud**,  
Founder & CEO of **Programming Advices** and Chairman of **Epya Solutions**.

Dr. Abu-Hadhoud brings **nearly 30 years of professional experience** in software engineering, IT solutions, project and program management, and organizational excellence. He holds a Doctorate in Business Administration and has led multiple successful software and technology ventures.

The roadmap reflects his practical, industry-driven approach to building strong programming foundations and producing job-ready software engineers.
