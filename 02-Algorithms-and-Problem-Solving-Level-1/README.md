# Algorithms and Problem Solving - Level 1

## Course Overview
This course marks the second stage of the roadmap, focusing on the most critical skill in software engineering: **Algorithmic Thinking**. The core philosophy of this level is "Think Before You Code," emphasizing problem analysis and logical solution design independently of any programming language syntax.

## Technical Skills Acquired
- **Problem Analysis:** Learning how to deconstruct complex requirements into smaller, manageable logical steps.
- **Algorithmic Design:** Mastering the art of creating step-by-step procedures to solve specific tasks (The "How-To" of logic).
- **Visual Programming Logic:** Using **Flowcharts** to visualize decision-making processes, loops, and conditional branching.
- **Input-Process-Output (IPO) Model:** Identifying and structuring the flow of data within a logical solution.
- **Logical Reasoning:** Building a mental framework to solve problems without the distraction of programming syntax.

## Key Highlights
- **Practice-Driven Learning:** Analyzed and designed solutions for **50 carefully selected problems**.
- **Language-Agnostic Approach:** Focus entirely on logic to ensure a deep understanding of problem-solving patterns that apply to any programming language.
- **Foundation for Implementation:** Prepared the mental models required to transition into C++ implementation in the subsequent levels.
