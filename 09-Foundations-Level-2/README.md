# Foundations Level 2 – Networks, Internet & System Architecture

This repository documents the completion of **Foundations Level 2**, a course focused on expanding a developer’s horizon by understanding how modern software systems communicate, scale, and operate over the internet.

After mastering programming fundamentals and language-level concepts, this course shifted the focus toward infrastructure, networking, and software architecture, which are essential for building connected, secure, and production-ready applications.

## Course Overview

This course provides a deep understanding of how data moves across networks, how internet infrastructure is structured, and how large-scale software systems are architected. It bridges the gap between writing code on a local machine and designing systems that operate in distributed, real-world environments.

## Technical Skills and Concepts Acquired

### Networking and Internet Infrastructure

- Understanding data transmission using packets and the TCP/IP protocol suite, including IPv4 and IPv6  
- Network architecture concepts including routers, gateways, modems, NAT, DHCP, and subnetting  
- Addressing and identification using IP addresses, MAC addresses, ports, and sockets  
- Clear distinction between the Internet and the World Wide Web  
- In-depth understanding of HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, DNS, URLs, and request–response mechanics  
- Fundamental concepts of network security, privacy, and VPN operation  

### Software Architecture and Modern Systems

- Understanding how systems communicate using APIs  
- Working with data exchange formats such as JSON and XML  
- Exploring the 3-Tier Architecture used in enterprise-level applications  
- Introduction to Business Intelligence concepts and data-driven decision systems  
- Understanding the complexity and cost of large-scale software systems  
- Use of GUIDs to ensure data integrity across distributed environments  

## Engineering Mindset Developed

- Transition from a local-machine mindset to a distributed-systems mindset  
- Understanding the impact of latency, security, and network protocols on application performance  
- Recognizing the importance of standardized communication formats in cross-platform systems  
- Building architectural awareness beyond code implementation
