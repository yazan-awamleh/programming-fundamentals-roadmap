# Data Structures – Level 1

## Course Overview

This course marks a critical transition in my programming journey: moving from building applications to understanding how data is organized and managed internally. After mastering OOP, I explored the foundational structures that power efficient software. The focus was on choosing the right tool for the job based on performance metrics, ensuring that the code is not just functional, but optimized for scale.

## Technical Skills & Concepts Mastered

### Algorithm Analysis (Big O Notation)

- Performance Evaluation: Gained a deep understanding of Time and Space Complexity to measure algorithm efficiency.  
- Complexity Classes: Mastered the analysis of various time complexities, including O(1) (Constant), O(n) (Linear), O(n²) (Quadratic), and O(log n) (Logarithmic).  
- Informed Decision Making: Learning to reason about which data structure provides the best performance for specific operations like searching, inserting, or deleting.  

### Linked Lists (Implementation & Logic)

Implemented various types of linked lists from scratch to understand memory management and pointer manipulation:

- Singly Linked List: Mastering node creation, traversal, and dynamic insertion/deletion.  
- Doubly Linked List: Handling bidirectional traversal and complex node adjustments.  
- Circular Linked List: Understanding circular logic and its practical use cases.  

### Linear Data Structures

- Stack: Implementing LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) logic, both manually and using the STL (Standard Template Library).  
- Queue: Mastering FIFO (First-In-First-Out) logic and its application in scheduling and data buffering.  
- Arrays & Matrices: Deep-diving into contiguous memory allocation and multi-dimensional data organization.  

### Advanced Foundational Concepts

- Abstract Data Types (ADT): Understanding the separation between the logical behavior of a data structure and its implementation.  
- Vectors: Utilizing dynamic arrays for efficient memory management.  
- Maps & Unions: Introduction to key-value pairing and memory-efficient data structures.  
- DS vs. Database: Understanding the fundamental differences between in-memory data organization and persistent storage systems.  

## Engineering Mindset

- Efficiency First: Always considering the cost of an operation before implementing it.  
- Structural Integrity: Choosing data structures based on the nature of the data and the most frequent operations.  
- Foundation for Algorithms: Establishing the necessary knowledge to tackle advanced algorithms and complex problem-solving in the future.
