# OOP as it Should Be - Core Concepts

## Course Overview

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is not just a syntax; it is a design mindset. This course marks my transition from writing functional, procedural code to designing scalable and maintainable software systems. After building a solid foundation in C++ and problem-solving, I revisited software development through the lens of OOP, focusing on how to model real-world problems into objects, classes, and robust hierarchies.

## Technical Skills & Principles Mastered

### The Four Pillars of OOP

- Encapsulation: Mastering the art of hiding data and grouping it with the methods that operate on it to ensure data integrity using Access Specifiers (Private, Public, Protected).
- Abstraction: Focusing on essential qualities rather than implementation details, reducing complexity through clean interfaces.
- Inheritance: Building reusable code and hierarchical relationships, including handling constructors in base/derived classes and mastering visibility modes.
- Polymorphism: Implementing dynamic behavior through Virtual Functions and Dynamic Binding, allowing for flexible and extensible code.

### Advanced Class Design

- Lifecycle Management: Designing Constructors (Parameterized & Copy) and Destructors to manage object initialization and cleanup.
- Static Members & Methods: Utilizing class-level data and functions that exist independently of specific objects.
- Special Relationships: Implementing Friend Classes and Functions and understanding the mechanics of the `this` pointer.
- Memory & Objects: Deep understanding of how objects are represented in memory, and how to manage arrays and vectors of objects.

## Design & Organization

- Separation of Concerns: Organizing code by separating classes into independent libraries (.h and .cpp files).
- Abstract Classes & Interfaces: Defining blueprints for other classes using Pure Virtual Functions.
- Nested Structures: Working with structures and classes inside other classes for better logical grouping.

## Projects Completed

- Calculator Project: Implementing a functional OOP-based calculator.
- String Library Project: Building a custom, reusable library for advanced string manipulation.
- Date & Period Library: Designing a complex system to handle dates and time periods using OOP principles.

## Engineering Mindset

- Shifting from "How to write code" to "How to design code."
- Prioritizing maintainability, reusability, and reducing code duplication.
- Understanding exactly when to use OOP to solve design problems and when to keep it simple.
